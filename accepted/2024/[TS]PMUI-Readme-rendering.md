- [Feature Spec](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/7943122dffa435f4daeee600efcc5b744cd2e97e/accepted/2023/PMUI-Readme-rendering.md)

## Summary

We want to update the packages pane in the PMUI to render the ReadMe for the selected package.

## Motivation 

The Readme file is an essential source of information that can help customers understand what a package does. By rendering the Readme file directly in the PM UI, customers can easily access the information they need to determine if a package will be helpful to them while searching, browsing, and managing their projectsâ€™ packages. This enhancement streamlines the user experience and may encourage package authors to create comprehensive Readme documentation when customers will be more likely to rely on it for useful information about the package.

## Explanation

### Functional explanation
When a package is selected we will determine if a ReadMe file exists and if it does we'll render it in the PM UI. 

The PM UI will be updated to have tabs for the Package Details and the the ReadMe. This UX will be displayed for both the Browse and installed tabs. It will also be displayed for both the solution level and project level package managers.

The ReadMe file will be selected from disk if available otherwise pulled from package source.

<!-- Introduce new concepts, functional designs with real life examples, and low-fidelity mockups or  pseudocode to show how this proposal would look. -->

### Technical explanation
We want to leverage the [IMarkdownPreview](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VS-Platform?path=/src/Productivity/MarkdownLanguageService/Impl/Markdown.Platform/Preview/IMarkdownPreview.cs) class to render the ReadMe in the IDE. A new instance can be created using [PreviewBuilder](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VS-Platform?path=/src/Productivity/MarkdownLanguageService/Impl/Markdown.Platform/Preview/PreviewBuilder.cs). 

We can use the Preview builder as follows:
```C#
//This creates a new instance of the preview builder
var markdownPreview = new PreviewBuilder().Build();

//We update the current markdown being rendered by calling "UpdateContentAsync"
markdownPreview.UpdateContentAsync(markDown ?? string.Empty, ScrollHint.None)

//IMarkdownPreview.VisualElement contains the FrameworkElement to be passed to the view
MarkdownPreviewControl = markdownPreview.VisualElement
```

For packages that are already on the disk we will retrieve the ReadMe from the root folder of the package. We will need to confirm if the current API returns the ReadMe when fetching package details and determine which API we should use to get the data.

## Drawbacks

This control is not currently using Daytona. There are plans to upgrade it, [Experience 1870733](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1870733), but they have been delayed. 

It's also currently marked as obsolete since the interface has not been finalized. So when an upgrade is made we may have to change how we use the control.

## Rationale and alternatives
By using an existing control we maintain consistency throughout the IDE and can rely on the owner to fix any bugs with the control.

## Prior Art
The IMarkdownPreview is currently being used when creating a new pull request inside of Visual Studio.

## Unresolved Questions
1. Will we show readme in the updates tab?
1. What do we show if the package has a ReadMe.txt instead of md?
    * Current suggestion is to focus on ReadMe.md. Once that's complete see how ReadMe.txt would appear when rendered. 
    * How many packages have a ReadMe.txt vs ReadMe.md?
1. What do we show if there is no ReadMe defined?
    - [ ] Hide the tab from the the details pane
    - [ ] Display the tab with a message saying there is no ReadMe defined.
1. Where do we get the ReadMe from when it's not on the disk?
    - Does the current API return the ReadMe information when searchin for a package?
    - If not is there an API to retrieve the ReadMe information?
1. Where are the ReadMe files saved in a package? 
    - There are examples of them being in root folder as well as a _content folder. 
1. What do we want the UX to be when an exception or error occurs while reading a ReadMe file?
